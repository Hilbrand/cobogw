# Using the org.cobogw.gwt.jar file #

To use the org.cobogw.gwt.jar file you need to manually change some settings. Adapt your `<your_project>.gwt.xml` file. Add the following line to the xml file:

> `<inherits name='org.cobogw.gwt.user.User' />`

If you are using the scripts generated by GWT, you need to adapt these as well:
  * Adapt your compile script: `<your_project>-compile.cmd`. Add the `org.cobogw.gwt.jar` file including the full path to the classpath as set via the **-cp** option.
  * Adapt your shell script: `<your_project>-shell.cmd`. Add the `org.cobogw.gwt.jar` file including the full path to the classpath as set via the **-cp** option.

**Problem solving:**

> `[ERROR] Line <number>:  The import org.cobogw.gwt.user cannot be resolved`
Solution: You very likely miss the `inherits` tag in your `<project>.gwt.xml` file.

> `[ERROR] Failure to load module 'null'`
Solution: You might have missed the `/` at the end of the inherits tag.

# Using the org.cobogw.gwt.jar file in eclipse #
If you use eclipse add the jar file to your project. You can do this as follows:

  * For source code references, add the jar file to the **Project Properties** in the **Java Build Path** under **Libraries** add as external jar.
  * For running your application from within eclipse add the jar file to the **Run...** options. Select your project and go to the **Classpath**. Place the jar file under the **User Entries** as external jar.
